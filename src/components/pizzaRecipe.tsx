          For the dough
        </h4>
        <p>
          This recipe is for a 24 hour prove. It sounds like a long time, but
          it's worth it. Don't worry. Simply make the dough the night before you
          want to make pizza and you will be good to go on the following
          evening. Don’t worry about exact timings, anywhere around 20-28 hours
          will be fine.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Mix all the ingredients into a shaggy mass in a large bowl, starting
            by adding the water first. You can do this by hand or use a wooden
            spoon.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cover the bowl with cling film, a plastic carrier bag, or a damp
            cloth (if the cloth isn’t damp the dough may dry out).
          </li>
          <li>
            Leave the dough to rest for around 1 hour (the technical term for
            this process is the Autolyse).
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn the dough out onto the counter and knead for around 5 minutes.
            Feel free to check out my article on kneading here, it’s easy!
          </li>
          <li>Place the dough back into the bowl and cover.</li>
          <li>
            Leave the dough to prove (in one big lump, don’t worry about the
            shape) for around 20 hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            Divide the dough into 4 equal parts (250g each) using some kitchen
            scales and a knife (or dough scraper). Do this about 4 hours before
            you intend to cook the pizza (after about a 20 hour prove).
          </li>
          <li>
            Place each dough ball into a small bowl and cover. Alternatively,
            use a large tupperware container with a lid, or two smaller ones.
          </li>
          <li>Leave the dough balls to prove again for about 4-6 hours.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4 className="mb-6 text-2xl font-semibold font-barlow">
          For the tomato sauce
        </h4>
        <p>
          Do not skimp on the tomatoes, quality tinned tomatoes are key to this
          simple sauce. Instead of cooking the sauce, you can thicken it by
          sieving (after blending) if you prefer.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Blend a tin of quality plum tomatoes into a smooth sauce.</li>
          <li>
            Cook the sauce until it reaches the desired thickness (still runny
            but quite thick).
          </li>
          <li>
            Add a tablespoon or 2 of tomato puree for a richer, sweeter sauce
            (optional).
          </li>
          <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4 className="mb-6 text-2xl font-semibold font-barlow">
          For the shaping/cooking
        </h4>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Shape and cook the pizzas one at a time. If the pizzas are shaped
            and left to sit before cooking, they may stick to the surface and
            then rip when moved. Speed is important!
          </li>
          <li>
            When loading the pizza onto the peel/chopping board, be sure to use
            a little sprinkle of flour. And again be quick! Once the pizza is on
            the peel, load it straight into the oven. These tips should prevent
            the pizza from sticking.
          </li>
          <li>
            Removing moisture from fresh mozzarella stops the pizza from
            becoming soggy. This can be done by breaking it up and wrapping it
            in kitchen roll 30 minutes before.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can also buy low moisture mozzarella which requires no
            preperation. This is the easiest option for ensuring you don’t end
            up with soggy pizza!
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
          <li>Ensure that you baking stone/tray is inside your oven.</li>
          <li>
            Get your oven up to temperature. For pizza ovens 420 – 480 degrees
            Celsius (790 – 900 Fahrenheit). For a regular domestic oven, as hot
            as it will get (around 260 Celsius or 500 Fahrenheit). An infrared
            thermometer is useful here for measuring the temperature of the
            cooking surface
          </li>
          <li>
            Dust a dough ball with plenty of flour and remove from the
            container. Place the dough into a large bowl with a generous
            covering of flour in the base of it.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the bowl, press down from the centre of the dough towards the
            edges. The idea here is to move the air from the middle of the dough
            to the outside, where it will form a crust. Be careful not to press
            the edge of the dough down (the crust), any air removed cannot be
            regained and you will not end up with a well-risen crust.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep turning the dough as you work the air towards the edges. You
            should start forming a small pizza shape at this stage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn the dough over and repeat this process in the bowl, on the
            other side.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove from the bowl and place on the counter, ensuring the base of
            the dough is coated with plenty of flour.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stretch the dough – remembering not to touch the edge of the dough
            (the crust), hold the dough down with your right hand, and with the
            other gently stretch the dough outwards.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repeat the stretch – keep turning the dough and repeating this until
            you have a base which is about 9 to 10 inches in diameter. You can
            usually go thinner than you think so don’t worry too much about the
            dough ripping.
          </li>
          <li>
            Top the base with around 2 soup spoons (dessert spoons) of tomato
            sauce and spread gently across the pizza and up to the edges (just
            before the crusts). Be careful not to press down as you spread or
            you may make the dough stick to the counter.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spread about a handful of Mozzarella (half of a 125g packet) evenly
            across the pizza, and you are ready to cook! (We will add the
            parmesan, basil, and olive oil after cooking.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Slide the pizza onto a peel (that has a dusting of flour on it), or
            chopping board if you don’t have a peel
          </li>
          <li>Load straight onto baking stone/tray inside oven.</li>
          <li>
            For a pizza oven, cook for around 60 – 90 seconds and turn every 20
            – 30 seconds as required. For a regular domestic oven, cook for
            around 6 – 8 minutes, turning about every 2 – 3 minutes as required.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove the pizza from the oven (preferably with a peel) and place on
            a chopping board or a plate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Grate parmesan on top and add some torn basil. Finish with a drizzle
            of olive oil and a sprinkling of black pepper if you like.
          </li>
          <li>Let the pizza cool a little.</li>
